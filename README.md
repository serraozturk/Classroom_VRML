This VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language) project represents a virtual classroom environment. The primary purpose of this environment is to simulate a classroom setting, including structural elements such as walls, floors, and ceilings, as well as interactive components like students, teachers, windows, lights, board, clock and various classroom objects. The project aims to provide an immersive and interactive experience that can be utilized for various educational purposes, including virtual learning and classroom management simulations.

The Classroom Management System is a comprehensive application written in Common Lisp, designed to simulate and manage various elements within a classroom setting. This system allows users to interact with and manipulate the classroom environment, including details about students, the teacher, the board, windows, and lights. The following documentation provides an in-depth look into the system, detailing its components, functionalities, and how users can interact with it
